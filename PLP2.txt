C++ typically names variables in the Camel Case standard (myVar). They are case sensitive and must begin with a letter or an underscore. Adding an int and a float results in a new float. Lists cannot have mixed variable types.


1. Does your language have keywords or reserved words? How many?
C++ has 97 keywords.
2. What are the naming requirements for variables in your language? What about naming conventions?  Are those enforced by the compiler/interpreter, or just 
standards in the community?
They are case sensitive and must begin with a letter or an underscore. No special symbols are allowed. The camel case is optional, but it a strong convention from the community.
3. Is your language statically or dynamically typed?
Statically typed.
4. Strongly typed or weakly typed?
Strongly typed.
5. Explicitly typed or implicitly typed?
Explicitly typed.
6. Are some variables mutable while others are immutable?
Variables are immutable.
7. What are the operators available for each data type?
Arithmetic: +-*/%++--. Assignment: =,+=,-=,*=,/=,%=,&=,|=,^=,>>=,<<=. Comparison: ==,!=,>,<,>=,<=. Logical: &&, ||, !.
8. Are mixed type operations allowed? If so, how are they accommodated?
Mixed operations are allowed for number variables. They typically turn into floats or doubles depending on the equation.
9. At what point are identifier names and operator symbols bound in your language?
They're bound at run time. They can be overwritten.
10. Describe the limitations (or lack thereof) of your programming language as they relate to the 
coding example portion of the assignment (adding ints and floats, storing different types in lists, 
converting between data types).  Are there other restrictions or pitfalls that the documentation 
mentions that you need to be aware of?
There are so many library imports all the time.
11. Are there built-in complex data types that are commonly used in your language? (hint: theyâ€™d 
probably appear fairly early in the documentation if so)
Strings are weirdly complicated. So are maps.
