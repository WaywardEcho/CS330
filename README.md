# C++
This repository is for learning how to write in C++.

# Overview & Setup

## History
C++ was created to be a general purpose programming language in 1985. It was made by Danish computer scientist Bjarne Stroustrup. It was initially made as an extension of C. C++ is used in a lot of types of programs. This is such as search engines, OSes, game and film productions because of its high speed.

### Primary Source
As of right now, I'll be referencing W3Schools and cplusplus.

## Installation
I already had [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) installed, so I decided to stick with it since it had extensions that supported running C++. I installed the extensions specifically related to C++ and then followed the instructions that VS Code gave that allowed the program to run C++. I had some difficulty with the terminal part of the instructions, but was able to follow along with a [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw5qjRNlC-Y) that Sawyer recommended.	There wasn't really a recommended programming environment that I could find made specifically for C++, but since I use Windows and already use VS Code, all of that together led me to stick with using VS Code.

### Running Programs
If using VS Code, the program (VS Code) needs to be opened in it's developer mode. From there, have a file open and then run/run and debug like any other language. For Windows, there are several options. Be sure to use the one labeled g++. After, it may ask for an exe, make sure to run with it.

## Hello World
The code below is an example of a C++ Hello World program. Copy it to see if you're able to run C++.

```
//Code is from https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/C%2B%2B_Programming/Examples/Hello_world
// 'Hello World!' program 
 #include <iostream> 
int main()
{
  std::cout << "Hello World!" << std::endl;
  return 0;
}
```
### Comments
Use a double forward-slash "//".
